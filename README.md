# picoCTF_solutions

## Purpose
These are the solutions for my picoCTF run through. It's written in a way that shows my thoughts through the entire process even if some of the strategies don't pan out. Often times write ups don't show what you've got wrong or the difficulties you encounter. Since this is supported to be a way to share your knowledge with folks, leaving out the struggles doesn't paint a complete picture.
